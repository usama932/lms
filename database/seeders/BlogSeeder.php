What’s unprecedented about the COVID-19 coronavirus global pandemic is how fast it’s spreading all over the world.

Schools are shutting down at an alarming rate, public gatherings and events of all kinds are being cancelled, and many workplaces are having as many employees as possible work from home. For companies everywhere, now is the time to creatively leverage a learning management system (LMS) like eLeaP to keep help keep your business operating.</p><h2><strong>An LMS is Uniquely Suited to Help During the COVID-19 Pandemic</strong></h2><p>Of course your company has email for communicating with employees working from home, and all kinds of video conference apps for having live meetings, but both of those technologies have their limitations. Your workers need to see their leaders and managers, not just read messages from them, but video conferencing isn’t a good solution for large-scale communication given the challenges of having everyone participate at the same time. This is when you could leverage the power of an easy-to-use LMS like <a href="https://www.eleapsoftware.com/">eLeaP</a> to get business-critical messaging across to your employees without everyone having to be online at the same moment.</p><p>eLeaP’s <a href="https://www.eleapsoftware.com/comprehensive-learning-management-system/">comprehensive features</a> were designed to be a simple yet powerful solution that makes uploading and distributing video content extremely fast and easy. The company CEO, other C-suite executives, managers, and team leaders can quickly record videos, get them uploaded into the LMS, and designate who needs to be notified the content is there and ready to be watched.</p><h2><strong>Let an LMS be Your HR Tool During the Pandemic</strong></h2><p>Your company’s HR professionals are going to be among the most hard-pressed staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Workers are going to have all kinds of questions about how remote working is going to happen, how their pay may or may not be affected, what the expectations are in terms of hours and availability, and all sorts of other questions. What’s the best way to begin assembling resources, guides, and messaging to address all these HR issues? Once again it’s an LMS that has capability to quickly house and distribute all this information. Whether it’s video content recorded by HR staff, PDFs, PowerPoint slide decks, or even just audio recordings, a well-designed LMS can handle all these different types of content and make them immediately available to everyone or to designated users as needed.</p><h2><strong>During a Business Slow-Down, Use an LMS for Training and Upskilling</strong></h2><p>How the COVID-19 global pandemic affects any given business is going to vary widely from company to company, and even by different types of workers and employees within companies. In some cases, whether working from home or not, some employees may not see any change at all in the volume of work they do on a day-to-day basis. In other cases, however, a slow-down in the business may mean there’s simply not as much to do for some workers.</p><p>This is when you can engage in additional eLearning through an LMS for the training programs there previously never seemed to be time for doing. For employees who have less to do, this could be the time when they can engage in significant upskilling and additional training. When the COVID-19 pandemic ends and businesses get back to normal operations, you’ll have a workforce that’s ready to do more to get the company back on track and moving forward.</p><h2><strong>Keeping the COVID-19 Pandemic in Perspective</strong></h2><p>Everyone is feeling anxious about the huge disruption to life and work being caused by the drastic measures that must be taken to slow the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus. After all, we were experiencing the longest post-recession economic recovery in history. There can be no doubt that this global pandemic is going to push the economy into a recession. Businesses are going to be impacted, some more than others, but no business will go unscathed during this crisis.</p><p>What’s important to keep in mind is this: Everyone, and I do mean everyone—every single business and every single employee with in every business—has a responsibility to do everything we can to protect the most vulnerable people in society, meaning the ones who will be killed by COVID-19 if they become infected. Keep this in mind when you’re feeling the negative business impacts of the pandemic. There are lives at stake if we don’t handle this right, and that means prioritizing people’s lives over and above the business, as difficult as that is. We are literally all in this together, and we will get through this crisis together!</p><p>If your company hasn’t yet adopted an LMS, now is the time to get it done. While we normally recommend a thorough process for assessing your company’s needs before selecting an LMS vendor, time is of the essence in the midst of a global pandemic. What we can tell you with confidence is this: The eLeaP LMS is extremely user-friendly. In fact, it’s been ranked #9 on Capterra’s Top 20 Most User-Friendly LMS Software list for several years in a row. And it’s incredibly easy to get up and running with eLeaP—literally in a matter of minutes.</p><p>eLeaP is a cloud-based LMS, which means there’s no software to download and install. All you need is your favorite electronic device (desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone) with an internet connection and a web browser. We offer a <a href="https://www.eleapsoftware.com/free-trial/">free trial</a> where you can start using eLeaP right away to see for yourself, and at the end of the free trial, you’ll appreciate the very <a href="https://www.eleapsoftware.com/pricing/">affordable monthly pricing</a> based on the number of users.</p>',

If you were to create a list of all the different corporate LMS options available for businesses, do you know how many would be on it? More than 640! There surely wouldn’t be so many different companies making and selling LMS software if there isn’t a real need for it, right? But you’re an LMS skeptic, and the true skeptic doesn’t do something just because everyone else is doing it!</p><p><strong>LMS Dissatisfaction is Still High</strong></p><p>Maybe you’ve also seen the many articles published online over the years that present data on how many companies are unhappy with their LMS. The most recent data on this is quite interesting. It comes from a research project at ATD (the Association for Talent Development). Their research team asked the important question, <a href="https://www.td.org/research-reports/is-the-lms-dead">Is the LMS Dead?</a> The answer was no, it’s alive and well, but get a load of these statistics:</p><ul><li><i><strong>Only 9%</strong></i> of companies surveyed were able to say their LMS was highly effective.</li><li><i><strong>Around 33%</strong></i> said employee users found the company LMS “difficult” to use (which is just a nice way of saying they hate it).</li><li><i><strong>Nearly 50%</strong></i> said the user interface of their LMS was not appealing.</li></ul><p>As an LMS skeptic, you’re probably thinking you’ve made the right choice in <i>not</i> adopting an LMS. But you’d be wrong. Just because a bunch of companies haven’t found the right LMS doesn’t mean it’s entirely unavailable. And if you stubbornly refuse to find the right LMS for your company, you’ll be missing out on the ways an LMS can boost learning and training, which has an impact on your bottom line.</p><p><strong>The Skeptic’s Guide to LMS</strong></p><p>We wanted to design a resource that would speak directly to the LMS skeptic. The goal was to explain as clearly as possible what an LMS can and cannot do for a company. An LMS isn’t a magic bullet, it’s a management tool with a relatively narrowly defined purpose and scope. If you understand what an LMS can do while not expecting it to do more than is possible, you will see how an LMS really can improve the way learning and training happens in your company.

When you have a larger audience and you need to convey a lot of information in an easy-to-access format, eLearning through an LMS software (<a href="https://www.eleapsoftware.com/comprehensive-learning-management-system/">LMS Learning Management System)</a> presents the ideal solution. It is important, however, to take the time to get to know the various resources that are available and see what they have to offer.

That can make it a challenge to figure out which platforms are going to be best for the job at hand. In fact, in 2021, it is expected that this market will be worth close to $16 billion, with the majority of the revenue generated in North America.</p><p>Studies have shown that over 40% of the global Fortune 500 companies out there are now using some type of online learning to help instruct employees with formal <a href="https://www.eleapsoftware.com/on-the-job-training-why-ojt-matters/">job training</a> and other educational needs. With the growing trend of online learning, it’s expected that as many as half of all available college courses are now online or somehow based in eLearning technology. It’s becoming glaringly obvious that the growing demand for virtual learning systems is there and that companies need to get on board.</p><p>The eLearning industry is changing the way people look at skill acquisition and job training. The ability to implement and manage a learning solution virtually can save companies a lot of time and money on their training efforts. Of course, because there are so many different solutions out there, it is important to take the time to explore the industry and find the solutions that work best for your specific training needs. Keep reading to learn more about LMS platforms and what you should be getting from them, as well as how you can use them to revolutionize your own training programs.</p><p><strong>LMS-What It Means to You</strong></p><p>Simply put, an LMS software is a <a href="https://www.eleapsoftware.com/learning-management-system/">Learning Management System</a> or an integrated platform that is designed to organize and manage training materials and educational courses, providing a user-friendly interface through which people can access the materials and courses. These platforms are typically hosted online and cloud-based, making them easy to modify, adapt, and access for everyone in the organization. This system is designed to make training easier, so if you find that you are struggling to actualize that goal, you might be going at things from the wrong direction.</p><p>Just because you have and use an LMS doesn’t mean that you’re making the best use of it, after all. Some people are employing these systems without a full understanding of what they offer or they simply roll out the first LMS software that they find without taking the time to do their homework and figure out which systems are actually going to be best for their needs. Fortunately, this guide has all of the insights and information that you need to ensure that you capitalize on your investment in a learning management system, no matter what type of training you have that needs to be done.</p><p><strong>Features of a Strong LMS Platform</strong></p><p>There are definitely some things that you should be looking for when you’re investing in an LMS software solution for your e-learning needs. There are a seemingly endless number of features available on various platforms, but you really need to take the time to figure out which features are most important to you. Do you know what you are looking for? If you are trying to make the most of your investment in this training tool, here are some big features that you really need to think about.</p><p><i>Data Migration</i></p><p>Your online learning platform should be able to move and integrate data seamlessly. Whether you are just investing in a new system and merging your previous LMS data or you are just trying to keep things integrated, the migration process in the software that you choose should provide you with all of the resources that you need to keep everything in one place.</p><p><i>Built-in Social Media Support</i></p><p>People are social creatures by nature. Now that social media plays such a large role in careers and other parts of life, having social media support and integration can be a value-added asset to any LMS. You can often incorporate social media groups and blogs that allow users to connect and work with their peers, as well as social tracking tools that will help you keep an eye on things like participation and engagement.</p><p><i>Gamification (Badges, etc.)</i></p><p>Who doesn’t love a good competition? People are naturally competitive and if you give them the tools to gamify their learning, they are going to feel more accomplished and be more likely to succeed. Motivating people is easier when you have points, leaderboards, and other tools that appeal to the competitive nature of people. When you choose a platform with these features, you’re giving people a fun way to learn and challenge themselves while also challenging their peers.</p><p><i>Reporting and Analytics Tools</i></p><p>It does no good to have the best LMS in place if you don’t know how it’s doing or how well the training is going for your employees. Any software worth its weight is going to include reporting and analytics tools, and the best ones will have customizable reporting options. While pre-built reports are nice, you are also going to have specific metrics that you want to track that other companies might not think about. That’s why having a robust platform that offers pre-planned reports and customized reporting together is the best solution.</p><p><i>Collaborative Learning Resources</i></p><p>Although eLearning is a rather effective means of training, there is definitely something to be said for taking a collaborative approach, as well. Some people experience the best learning in social media groups, online discussions, and other collaborations. Even if most of your training is a solo activity, you should still have engaging tools that allow people to collaborate and communicate during the training process. If your platform doesn’t have integrated collaborative tools, you should at least make sure that it has the option for plug-ins or add-ons so that you can capitalize on these resources in the event that you need them.</p><p><i>Branding and Corporate Integration</i></p><p>While it might not occur to you that something like your logo and company name could impact the quality of your training materials, you really need that cohesion across the board. People might not need to see the logo on every single training page, but having a branded, personalized training program that incorporates this can definitely give people the sense of cohesiveness that they expect from online training programs that are offered at a professional level.</p><p><i>Personalized Learning</i></p><p>The ability to provide your employees with personalized learning solutions is invaluable when you employ the use of an LMS platform. Everyone knows that “one size fits all” training is not effective in any situation. Some programs will allow you to create unique non-linear courses or personalized paths to learning for your trainees to help them learn the things that they may be missing. You can customize this to people’s specific gaps or areas where they struggle to ensure that you address what people need the most.</p><p><i>Easy-to-Use Interface</i></p><p>Finally, there is no value to an LMS software that isn’t easy for people to use. It doesn’t matter how well the rest of the features work or how many other checkboxes are marked off when you invest in one of these tools. The fact of the matter is that if the platform isn’t intuitive and user-friendly, it’s not going to be successful. Make sure that you test out the platform for yourself and do so from the perspective of the least-experienced Internet or computer user. That way, you’ll know that it’s the best solution and that everyone can use it to succeed with their eLearning programs.</p><p><i>Cloud-Based Learning</i></p><p>Although most LMS software platforms are already cloud-based, there are some installed software programs available, as well. Of course, hard-installed systems won’t have as much flexibility and customization. Plus, cloud-based systems are easier to change and update, and you can allow users to access the information from just about anywhere that they desire. While cloud-based learning isn’t absolutely necessary, it certainly makes things easier. Imagine if you lose connectivity in the office or if people suddenly decide they need to check in on a training module while they’re at home. Having a cloud-based solution with access from just about anywhere can make the difference. Plus, then when you need to scale up or down, or change anything in the LMS, you aren’t investing in expensive new hardware upgrades or other costs because everything is virtual and easy to scale.</p><p><i>Accessibility Across Devices</i></p><p>Although you might only have your team training in the office, having access to the LMS platform across devices can help your team. You should choose a platform that is responsive and can be accessed across a variety of devices just in case you need smartphone or tablet access for any reason. Plus, then your trainees will be able to come back and access training resources whenever they need them. Imagine that you find yourself in a situation where the Internet is down and you still want to get the training done. Having an LMS platform that offers offline connectivity can save you from a wasted day. These are all things that are important to think about, even if they may not seem like pressing issues. The more prepared you are, the better your eLearning will be. The right platform can make all the difference.</p><p><i>Customized Support 24/7</i></p><p>The most important thing with any LMS is being able to get help when it isn’t working as it should, or in the event that you need assistance for anything. Can you reach your support team via phone, email, and/or live chat? Make sure that you ask about support services <strong>before</strong> you commit to a solution. You should also check reviews and see what other users say about ongoing support. The company might be on the ball when you are ready to sign up to work with them, but will they offer the same resources and support when you have paid for the services? That’s where it really counts.</p>',

The following are some tips that you will want to employ.</p><h3>Improve Trust in the Company</h3><p>How much do your employees trust the company? If you are overly secretive about changes being made at the company that will affect the employees, trust will erode. While there may be certain things that you cannot divulge to the employees, being as transparent in other areas is very important. If there are important changes coming, make sure that the managers and the employees are a part of this conversation as early as possible.</p><p>Make sure that everyone in the company knows the core values, as well. Transparency helps to build better relationships in the company, and it can make sure that everyone is aligned in their goals and values. It also allows for better and more engagement.</p><h3>Become More Flexible</h3><p>In some companies, there are still rigid and traditional company cultures that tend not to work well in the modern environment. Becoming more flexible and accommodating for the employees can provide massive improvements to the way that people feel about the company and their role within it. Offering flexible hours and work schedules can often be helpful.</p><h3>Create Strong Coworker Connections</h3><p>People who are in the workplace should feel like they belong there, and they should feel as if they are a part of the team. Those companies that have people who all have the same goals, and who feel as if they are part of a larger team are going to be more productive. By incorporating team-building activities and team outings, it can help to foster this type of connection between the coworkers.</p><p>Of course, when creating those outings, it is important to think about the people who are in the company. Not everyone wants to go out to a happy hour with the rest of the team. Not everyone can get away after the end of the workday for a movie because they have to think about their family at home. You want to have opportunities that everyone will be able to participate in without feeling as though they are being excluded.</p><h3>Everyone Should Have a Voice</h3><p>It is important that everyone in the workplace feel as if they have a voice that will be heard. Workplaces are diverse locations where people may not always feel as if they can voice their opinion regarding work, of they may feel as if it will not be heard. It is essential that the company culture is welcoming to everyone and that all employees know that their contributions are important and heard.</p><p>Managers should always hear everyone out whether the idea is good or bad. Otherwise, there is a chance that they could miss out on an idea that could help to take care of problems that exist or that could improve the company in some other way.</p><h3>Understand the Dangers of Burning Out</h3><p>One of the aspects of the workplace that does not always get enough attention is the concept of burnout amongst employees. When employees are feeling burned out, not only are they not going to be as productive to the company, but it can even create a bad environment for the other employees at the company. Understand how the employees work best and make sure that they have the flexibility they need, as mentioned above. Sometimes, changing up the work schedules or reducing the workload is necessary.</p><h3>Allow for Employee Feedback</h3><p>Even if you believe that there is nothing wrong with your company culture, you might not be seeing the entire picture. Those who are working in HR or who are managers are not always down “in the trenches” with everyone else. They do not always see everything that goes on, both good and bad. Therefore, the employees need to have a way to provide feedback about the job and their coworkers. Make it easy for the employees to speak with representatives from human resources, and make sure they understand that they can do so anonymously if needed.</p><h3>Recognition and Reward</h3><p>Another part of the company culture that can help to bring people together is to provide recognition and rewards for when individuals and teams do well. There are many ways that employees can be rewarded. They could be provided with a gift card, with a paid day off, a trip to a spa or movie, etc. This creates a more positive environment, and it helps to provide incentives that other employees will want to earn for themselves.</p><h3>Perform Culture Audits of the Company</h3><p>Even after you believe that you have improved the company culture, your work is not done. This is an ongoing project, and occasionally, you will need to audit and take an honest look at the company culture and how it might have changed in the past six months. Certain employees, for example, might be making life miserable for other employees, and you won’t always know this unless you are proactive with your audits. There needs to be maintenance to your company culture, and sometimes, it will need to evolve with the times.</p><p>What is the current company culture at your company like?
